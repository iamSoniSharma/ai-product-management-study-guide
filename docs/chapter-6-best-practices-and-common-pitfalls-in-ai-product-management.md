# Best Practices & Common Pitfalls in AI Product Management (Part 6 of AI PM Study Guide)

**Intro**  
By now, we’ve looked at what AI PMs do, how their role differs, and frameworks for designing human-centered AI.  

But let’s be honest: *It’s easy to get AI wrong.* Models can misfire, projects stall, trust evaporates. The difference between a strong AI PM and an average one often comes down to the **habits they follow — and the mistakes they avoid.**  

Let’s walk through **best practices to embrace** and the **pitfalls to dodge**, with some stories along the way.

## ✅ Best Practices Every AI PM Should Follow

### 1. Start With the Problem, Not the Model 🎯  
AI is shiny, but don’t start with “let’s use GPT.”  
👉 Instead: define the business problem and test if AI is the right tool.  

**Story (Retail):**  
A PM was pressured to “add AI” to the store app. Instead of jumping to chatbots, she reframed: *“Customers struggle to find products quickly.”* The team tested simple filters first, then layered in AI search. Result? **+18% conversion** with less complexity.

### 2. Build Data as a First-Class Asset 📦  
Your product is only as good as its data.  
- Collect responsibly (consent, diversity).  
- Monitor quality continuously.  
- Treat labeling and curation as part of the backlog.  

**Story (Voice AI):**  
Accuracy tanked for regional accents. The PM budgeted a data-labeling sprint, paying contributors across markets. Accuracy bounced back, and complaints dropped.  

---

### 3. Design for Explainability 🔍  
Users trust AI when they can see *why* it decided something.  
- Add local explanations (“this transaction flagged for new device + location”).  
- Provide repair paths (e.g., “Verify device”).  

**Story (Lending):**  
A loan denial tool added **reason codes + appeal options**. Customer support calls dropped, and regulators praised transparency.  

---

### 4. Close the Feedback Loop 🔄  
Feedback isn’t an afterthought — it’s the oxygen AI breathes.  
- 👍 Capture explicit signals (thumbs, ratings).  
- 👀 Capture implicit signals (time on page, corrections).  
- 🔁 Feed back into retraining pipelines.  

---

### 5. Always Plan for Failure 🚨  
- 🛑 Have fallbacks (rules, human review).  
- 📢 Design for graceful degradation (partial results > none).  
- 📂 Log everything for auditing.  

**Story (Healthcare):**  
When an AI diagnostic system wasn’t confident, the PM designed a fallback: “Show nearest specialist contact.” Instead of dead ends, users got help.  

---

### 6. Partner With Cross-Functional Teams 🤝  
The best AI PMs don’t work in silos. They:  
- Align with data scientists, engineers, and UX.  
- Bring in compliance and risk teams early.  
- Involve end-users in pilots.

## ❌ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Chasing Accuracy Only 📉  
High accuracy doesn’t equal good product. Ignore fairness, latency, UX → product fails.  

**Example:** A fraud model caught 99% of fraud but also blocked thousands of legit customers. Support calls exploded.  

---

### 2. Treating Data as “IT’s Problem” 🗂️  
PMs who ignore data pipelines or labeling bottlenecks get stuck later.  
AI backlog ≠ feature backlog; it includes data tasks.  

---

### 3. Launching Without Guardrails 🛑  
Never launch without monitoring, thresholds, or escalation paths.  
The fastest way to lose trust is to let AI fail silently.  

---

### 4. Ignoring Edge Cases 🌪️  
AI shines in patterns, but it’s edge cases that cause crises (bias, fraud, safety issues).  
Good PMs plan for the 1% outliers.  

---

### 5. Overhyping AI in Communication 📢  
Overselling leads to disappointment. Underpromise, overdeliver.  

**Story (Chatbot):**  
A PM pitched it as “your new human-like agent.” Expectations skyrocketed. When it failed, trust cratered. After rebranding as a “first-line helper,” adoption recovered.  

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways  

✅ Start with the problem, not the model.  
✅ Treat data as part of the product.  
✅ Design explainability, feedback, and fallbacks from day one.  
✅ Collaborate deeply with cross-functional teams.  
✅ Avoid accuracy obsession, hype, and launching without guardrails.  

AI PM isn’t about building “smart features.” It’s about **responsible, resilient systems** people trust.
