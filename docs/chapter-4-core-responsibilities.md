# Chapter 4 — Core Responsibilities of an AI Product Manager

Unlike traditional PMs, who focus on defining features and managing releases, AI Product Managers (AI PMs) oversee the entire lifecycle of products powered by data and machine learning. This role requires balancing business needs, user experience, and technical feasibility — while ensuring safety, fairness, and continuous improvement.

1. Collaborating with Data Scientists and ML Engineers

> AI PMs don’t write the models themselves, but they shape their development. Their job is to translate business goals into model requirements.

Example:

Business Goal: Reduce fraudulent credit card transactions by 30%.

> AI PM Translation: Train a fraud detection model with recall ≥ 90% (catch most fraud) and precision ≥ 40% (limit false alarms). Ensure training data includes multiple geographies and merchant types.

## Why this matters:

If the goal is unclear, engineers may optimize for accuracy without realizing that recall (catching fraud) is more critical than precision (avoiding false positives).

The AI PM ensures that technical targets align with business risk appetite.

## Analogy: The AI PM is like a coach setting the strategy, while data scientists and engineers are the players executing the game plan.

2. Aligning Business Strategy with AI Capabilities

Not every problem requires AI. The AI PM must evaluate whether AI adds unique value or whether simpler solutions suffice.

Decision Criteria:

Stakes: What happens if the AI is wrong? (e.g., A movie recommendation vs a cancer diagnosis).

Data: Do we have enough high-quality data to train the model?

Cost & Latency: Can the system deliver predictions fast enough and cheaply enough at scale?

Explainability: Do users (or regulators) require clear reasoning behind outputs?

Example:

Uber uses AI for demand prediction and dynamic pricing — this makes sense because demand shifts constantly, and real-time learning creates efficiency.

But Uber still uses rule-based logic for refund eligibility (e.g., if ride canceled by driver in under 2 mins, full refund). That doesn’t require AI.

The AI PM’s skill is knowing when AI is the right tool, and when to say no.

3. Iterative Development and Feedback Loops

AI products are never finished. Unlike rule-based features that can be built and left alone, AI systems drift as data changes.

Case Example — Spam Filters:

In 2005, spam emails often contained obvious phrases like “win lottery now.” Rules worked fine.

By 2020, spammers adapted, mimicking normal business emails. AI filters had to evolve continuously.

Today, filters retrain daily with millions of new samples.

The AI PM’s role:

Set up feedback loops (e.g., “Mark as Spam” button in Gmail).

Prioritize retraining pipelines to incorporate new patterns.

Monitor for model drift — when accuracy declines because the world has changed.

## Analogy: Managing AI is like tending a garden — constant watering, pruning, and replanting, not a one-time build.

4. Balancing Technical Feasibility with User Needs

Sometimes what users want isn’t technically feasible — or isn’t safe. The AI PM must find the right compromise.

Example 1 — Healthcare AI:

Users (doctors) want instant, 100% accurate diagnoses from medical images.

Reality: AI can assist, but errors happen.

> AI PM’s decision: Position the model as a decision support tool, not a replacement. Provide heatmaps showing where anomalies are detected to support doctors’ judgment.

Example 2 — Chatbots:

Users want fluent, human-like conversations.

Reality: Generative AI can hallucinate.

> AI PM’s decision: Add disclaimers, restrict certain queries (e.g., medical, legal), and build fallback flows to a human agent.

Framework:

What users want: Accuracy, speed, transparency.

What AI can deliver: Probabilities, sometimes errors, evolving performance.

> AI PM’s job: Balance expectation vs reality, ensuring value without overpromising.
