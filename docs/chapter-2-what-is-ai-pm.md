# Chapter 2 — What is AI Product Management?

Definition and Scope

AI Product Management (AI PM) is the discipline of developing, launching, and improving products that are powered by artificial intelligence. The AI PM ensures that AI capabilities are used to solve meaningful user problems, create business value, and operate safely.

Whereas a traditional PM focuses on defining features, managing backlogs, and aligning stakeholders, an AI PM must also:

Understand what AI can and cannot do.

Scope and secure the data needed to power the system.

Define success metrics that capture both product outcomes and model performance.

Build processes for continuous monitoring, retraining, and improvement.

Anticipate ethical and regulatory risks (bias, explainability, compliance).

In essence, AI PMs are translators: they connect the world of business and users with the highly technical world of data science and machine learning.

How it Compares with Traditional PM

To appreciate the scope of AI PM, let’s compare it with traditional PM:

> Traditional PM

Works with deterministic systems (e.g., payroll, tax calculators, form validation).

Writes feature specifications: “If user clicks X, show Y.”

Success measured by adoption, revenue, and satisfaction.

Main risks: bugs, usability gaps, missed deadlines.

> AI PM

Works with probabilistic systems (e.g., fraud detection, recommendations, generative text).

Writes data and model specifications: “Provide 10,000 labeled examples; model should achieve ≥ 85% recall at ≤ 20% false positives.”

Success measured by business outcomes and model metrics (accuracy, fairness, latency).

Main risks: biased models, hallucinations, model drift, loss of trust.

Example:

Imagine building a spam filter.

A traditional PM might specify: “Block emails containing words like ‘lottery’ or more than 5 links.”

An AI PM instead specifies: “Train a model on 500,000 labeled emails. Target accuracy of 95%, with recall ≥ 90% for spam.”

The AI PM’s work involves data quality, labeling standards, and evaluation metrics — things traditional PMs never had to consider.

New Responsibilities Unique to AI PM

Data Stewardship

Collect and curate data.

Ensure diversity and fairness (e.g., voice assistant must recognize different accents).

Monitor for drift (when real-world data changes and the model performance decays).

Case Example: An AI-powered hiring tool learned to down-rank female applicants because historical data favored men. An AI PM must anticipate and prevent such bias by curating balanced training data.

- Defining Model Metrics and Guardrails
Decide which errors are tolerable and which are not.

Example: A recommendation model suggesting an irrelevant movie is tolerable. A medical diagnosis model missing cancer is not.

Guardrails include thresholds, fallback to human review, and safe defaults.

Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

Traditional features are “done” after release; AI features are never done.

> AI PMs must set up pipelines to monitor accuracy, fairness, and latency after launch.

They coordinate retraining, model updates, and A/B testing.

Ethical and Regulatory Compliance

Ensure AI outputs are explainable, fair, and compliant with laws (e.g., GDPR, APRA CPS 230).

## Example: A credit scoring model must explain why a user was rejected, not just output “Declined.”

Cross-Functional Translation

Communicate with executives (“How does this improve revenue?”).

Collaborate with data scientists (“We need recall ≥ 90% and fairness across demographics”).

Work with designers (“Show model confidence levels to build trust”).

## Analogy: The Recipe vs The Chef

A traditional PM is like writing a detailed recipe for a dish: “Add 200g flour, bake for 20 minutes.”

An AI PM is like training a chef’s intuition: provide thousands of past dishes, feedback on taste, and ask the chef to generalize and create new meals.

The AI PM cannot control every step — they set goals, provide ingredients (data), and monitor outcomes.

✅ End of Chapter 2

By the end of this chapter, a beginner should clearly understand:

What AI PM is and how it differs from traditional PM.

## Why data, metrics, and guardrails are central to AI PM.

The expanded scope of responsibilities — from ethics to continuous monitoring.
